# SwipeNews App for iOS

## Overview

This project is a work-in-progress iOS app designed to revolutionize the news reading experience, offering a modern UI/UX surpassing traditional media outlets like Le Monde.

## Features

- Displaying news articles in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

- Utilizing SwiftUI and Combine for a reactive and efficient UI development.

- Leveraging Async/Await for asynchronous operations to enhance app responsiveness.

- Implementing Realm Swift for local database management, ensuring seamless data handling and offline access.

I want for the moment to outrageaously use the LocalDatabase because the API I use ([NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/)) only offers 100 calls/day for one account (and I let you see the price of the pay version on the associated link ðŸ‘€).

## Architecture

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, coupled with a robust protocol-oriented architecture. 

This architecture not only facilitates clean and maintainable code but also aids in creating comprehensive unit tests for each component of the app.

## Compatibility

- Minimum iOS Version: iOS 17

- As it is a personal project, I wanted to use the latest Apple APIs and frameworks to stay up-to-date with industry standards and best practices. And to have with fun with them ! 

## Getting Started

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Open the project in Xcode
3) Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical iOS device.
